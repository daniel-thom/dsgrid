# Dataset Submittal

This section guides you through submitting registered datasets to dsgrid projects.

Dataset **submittal** is the process of connecting a registered dataset to a project.
During submittal, dsgrid validates that the dataset meets the project's requirements
and applies dimension mappings.

```{note}
Dataset registration and submittal can be done separately or combined in a
single command. This section focuses on the submittal process; see
{doc}`/datasets/registration/index` for registration details.
