Datasets
*********
A dataset is defined by its :ref:`dataset-config`. This data structure describes the dataset's
attributes, dimensionality, and file format characteristics.

Types
=====
1. ``Benchmark``
2. ``Historical``
3. ``Modeled``

Trivial Dimensions
==================
Not all dataset dimensions have to be significant, e.g., historical data will generally have a
trivial (i.e., one-element) scenario dimension. We call these one-element dimensions ``trivial
dimensions``. For space saving reasons, these trivial dimensions do not need to exist in the
dataset files, however, they must be declared as trivial dimensions in the dataset config.

File Format
===========
A dataset must comply with a supported dsgrid file format. Please refer to :ref:`dataset-formats`
for options.

Examples
========
The `dsgrid-StandardScenarios repository
<https://github.com/dsgrid/dsgrid-project-StandardScenarios/tree/main/dsgrid_project/datasets>`_
contains datasets that you can use as examples.
